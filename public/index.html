                    <div id = "pronunciation"><p>Pronunciation:</p> Various suggestions have been made, including: (AK-ee-oh) or (AK-see-oh)-film, (AK-see-oh)-UK audio book and video game, (AS-see-oh)-US audio book, and (AT-chee-oh)-Anglo-Catholic pronunciation Accio cup.</div>
                    <div id = "description"><p>Description:</p> This charm summons an object to the caster, potentially over a significant distance. It can be used in two ways, either by casting the charm and then naming the object desired, or by pointing your wand at the desired object during or immediately following the incantation to 'pull' the target toward the caster, in either case, the caster must concentrate on the object they wish to summon towards them in order for the charm to succeed. The caster does not necessarily need to know the location of the target if they say the name of the object to be summoned, such as when Hermione Granger summoned some books from Dumbledores office simply by saying 'Accio Horcrux books!' while in Gryffindor Tower.
                    Harry Potter summoned his broom to complete the first task of the Triwizard Tournament in 1994, and to summon the Portkey to escape Voldemort and the Death Eaters in the Little Hangleton Graveyard in 1995. Also, in the Battle of the Seven Potters Harry summoned Hagrid when he fell. Molly Weasley used it to get the twins candy. The twins used it to summon their brooms from Dolores Umbridges office.
                    The summoning charm is limited only to items and small animals, as it was shown to be incapable of summoning people, it is also possible to bewitch items to become impervious to this spell.
                    The Latin word accio means 'I call' or 'I summon'.</div>
