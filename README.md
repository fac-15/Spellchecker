# Spellchecker

1. Clone into repository
2. Navigate to Spellchecker 
3. Write npm i in terminal 
4. Run server by writing node src/server.js in terminal
cross your fingers that you get the message "server is listening" 
5. Open your browser and go to localhost:3000

### Things we learnt

That getting a server up might be easy, but getting all of the functions to talk to the server properly is hard. 
Backend stuff isn't as intimidating as you might think. 
Nodemon is so useful. 

### Things we struggled with


### Things that went well! 

The CSS is responsive and writing the spells.json file went well. 

### How we found the whole project...

We struggled with having all of the different functions etc in different files and different folders. The problem for us was mostly connecting all of it.
