1. Clone into repository
2. Navigate to Spellchecker 
3. Write npm i in terminal 
4. Run server by writing node src/server.js in terminal
cross your fingers that you get the message "server is listening" 
5. Open your browser and go to localhost:3000

### Things we learnt

That getting a server up might be easy, but getting all of the functions to talk to the server properly is hard. 
Backend stuff isn't as intimidating as you might think. 
Nodemon is so useful. 

We can make an api call to our local server just like we make a api call to an extental server.

we learnt how the server, router and handler communicate. 
The server requires the router (where to go aka the route) and the protocol.
The router requires the path and what to do when you get there (aka the functions).
The functions requires and handles the object.



### Things we struggled with

Connecting the front-end to the backend.
Getting the planned functions to actually connect to the backend and the frontend. 
Most things.

### Things that went well! 

The CSS is responsive and writing the spells.json file went well.
Setting up the server went well in the end.
We planned well and we all were on the same page about what kind of functionality that we needed. 

### How we found the whole project...

We struggled with having all of the different functions etc in different files and different folders. The problem for us was mostly connecting all of it.
